        The croissant is a buttery, flaky pastry that originated in Austria, not
        France as many might think. Its history dates back to the 17th century,
        during the Ottoman Empire's siege of Vienna in 1683. Legend has it that
        Viennese bakers, working during the siege, heard the sound of the
        Turkish troops tunneling under the city. As a result, the bakers alerted
        the city's defenders, and the siege was thwarted. In celebration of the
        victory, the bakers created a pastry resembling the crescent moon symbol
        on the Ottoman flags. This pastry eventually evolved into what we now
        know as the croissant. The croissant gained popularity in France when it
        was introduced there in the 19th century, becoming an iconic French
        pastry. Today, it's enjoyed worldwide in various forms and flavors.
